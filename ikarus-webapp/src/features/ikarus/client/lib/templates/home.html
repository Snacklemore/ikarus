      <h1>WHAT IS THIS?</h1>


      <p>Ikarus is a team vs team mod for ARMA 3 without respawn, with a persistence layer managed in a web app.</p>

      <p><b>What are we hoping to achieve?</b></p>

      <p>
      The desperate one life per player, loot on the line feeling from DayZ. Fast, straight to business gameplay like Battle Royale, but focused on team versus team instead of free for all. Persistent progression managed with a web app, giving each team a continuing agenda, and each mission a feeling of going in to accomplish an objective as part of a larger campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
      This here is the IKARUS web app. Here you can log in with your steam account and manage your company: invite friends, change starting position, gear and such. When you want to play a game, you and your friends create a squad, select equipment, and enter into a server queue. When a server is free and enough teams are ready to play, slots will be reserved for your squad, and you will be given server details.</p>

      <p>
      When you and a bunch of other teams join the ARMA mission, you will be moved to your selected starting location and given your selected equipment. Mission objectives will then be generated depending on the mission you choose. After you accomplish your mission, you will get to keep all equipment and vehicles you bring back to your starting location. They will show in the webapp, and you will be able to use them in subsequent missions. All the equipment you donâ€™t bring back to the starting location, you will lose. If you get killed, you will be kicked from the server.</p>

      <p>
      Now, there will be other teams that are trying to accomplish the same objective as you, or will be in the area of operations doing something else. You can bet they are hostile, and that is where the fun is. Encounters around the objective will ensue, and you will get nice medium sized TvT matches with other teams.</p>
