      <h1>WHAT IS THIS?</h1>


      <p>Ikarus is a team vs team mod for ARMA 3 without respawn, with a persistence layer managed in a web app.</p>

      <p><b>What are we hoping to achieve?</b></p>

      <p>
      The desperate one life per player, loot on the line feeling from DayZ. Fast, straight to business gameplay like Battle Royale, but focused on team versus team instead of free for all. Persistent progression managed with a web app, giving each team a continuing agenda, and each mission a feeling of going in to accomplish an objective as part of a larger campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
      This here is the IKARUS web app. Here you can log in with your steam account and manage your company: invite friends, change starting position, gear and such. When you want to play a game, you and your friends create a squad, select equipment, and enter into a server queue. When a server is free and enough teams are ready to play, slots will be reserved for your squad, and you will be given server details.</p>

      <p>
      When you and a bunch of other teams join the ARMA mission, you will be moved to your selected starting location and given your selected equipment. Mission objectives will then be generated depending on the mission you choose. After you accomplish your mission, you will get to keep all equipment and vehicles you bring back to your starting location. They will show in the webapp, and you will be able to use them in subsequent missions. All the equipment you donâ€™t bring back to the starting location, you will lose. If you get killed, you will be kicked from the server.</p>

      <p>
      Now, there will be other teams that are trying to accomplish the same objective as you, or will be in the area of operations doing something else. You can bet they are hostile, and that is where the fun is. Encounters around the objective will ensue, and you will get nice medium sized TvT matches with other teams.</p>

      <h1>NEWS</h1>

      <h3>21.07.2015 Deploy outpost (Mod updated!)</h3>

      <p>You can now buy outpost backpacks in the marketplace. These allows you to deploy outposts during a mission. You can return loot and safely disconnect in your outpost. One company can only have max 6 outpost. Please also read the outpost briefing entry in game!</p>

      <p><b>Download new mod from <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ikarus.idleplaythings.com/mod/%40ikrs_v0.4.4.0.zip">here.</a></b></p>

      <h3>12.07.2015 Loot progression, military base raid (Mod updated)</h3>
      <p>Loot progression has been reworked. Now you will find boxes in both supply and hold depots that you will need a key to open. These keys can be found as part of loot from both missions (supply key from hold, and vice versa)</p>

      <p>
        New mission, "Military base raid" has also been added. To choose it, you will need "Intelligence" item. Military base raid will work like supply, but instead of depot in a house, there will be a small military base. Loot will also be quite different from supply mission;)
      </p>

      <p><b>Oh right, mod updated too. Download from <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ikarus.idleplaythings.com/mod/%40ikrs_v0.4.4.0.zip">here.</a></b></p>

      <h3>07.06.2015 Guard mission changes</h3>
      <p>Guards can now guard any depot and all guards are considered to be on the same side. This means that you will be penalized for killing other guards. Non guards can not equip guard uniform and guards removing theirs are considered enemies to other guards.</p>

      <p>It is also now possible to play an Ikarus game with only one squad. If that is the case, there will be AI guards guarding the depot. AI guards are only present when there are one squad in game. However, reinforcements can join the game normally.</p>


      <h3>03.06.2015 Reinforcements inbound! (mod updated!)</h3>
      <p>Did you miss that game start? Died early and have nothing to do? Now you can join an ongoing game as a reinforcement. Remember, still only one life per mission! Also, mod is updated, download new <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ikarus.idleplaythings.com/mod/%40ikrs_v0.4.4.0.zip">here.</a></p>


      <h3>14.05.2015 ACE 3 released! (mod updated!)</h3>
      <p>ACE 3 realism mod was released couple of days back and we are now using it in Ikarus. Please redownload ikarus mod from <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ikarus.idleplaythings.com/mod/%40ikrs_v0.4.4.0.zip">here.</a></p>

      <h3>24.04.2015 Website updated</h3>
      <p>Hopefully this looks more professional now.</p>


      <h3>17.04.2015 Mission objectives</h3>
      <p>You might have noticed, that mission objectives are no longer selected
      in squad ui. Squad leader will instead select the mission when game starts.</p>
