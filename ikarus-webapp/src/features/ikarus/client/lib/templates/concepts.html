      <h2>Base</h2>
      <p>
        Each squad starts their Ikarus mission in their Base. Everything inside a 20m radius of your base you get to
        keep after the mission. You don't need to unload cars. You will even get equipment from dead corpses in your
        base.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          The exact location of your base is always marked on the map.

      <h2>Outposts</h2>
      <p>
        Each company can have up to six outposts. To deploy an outpost take an outpost backpack on a mission with you.
        You can return loot in an outpost just like your base.
      </p>

      <p>
        The outpost activates in the next mission from it's deployment. Anyone can dismantle an outpost.
        So don't leave your enemies outposts standing and make sure yours are out of sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another advantage of outposts is that you can teleport to any of your outposts from your base at the start
        of the mission.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Having multiple outposts gives you a lot of tactical flexibility.

      <h2>Depots</h2>
      <p>
        Many Ikarus missions use depots as mission targets. The depots are fortified buildings or
        larger military installations. Depots usually contain the loot and the objective.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the right you can see some example of depots.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          If you have trouble finding a depot, remember that most depots are in buildings that you can see in the Arma 3 map.

      <h2>Loot boxes</h2>
      <p>
        In many missions the main, or secondary, target is to get loot from the depot. This loot is usually in a loot
        box. To open a loot box you have to stand next to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that you can't open loot boxes before 20 minutes of game time has elapsed. This is to prevent people
        from looting the depot before other squads have time to get to the combat. After 30 minutes opening becomes 3
        times faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        Green loot boxes require a key. Read more about them in the <b>Supply run</b> and <b>Hold</b> missions.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the box is open, it will change into an accessible container.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          To keep item loot from boxes, you have to bring it back to your base or an outpost. (Unless you are the last
          player remaining, in which case you can log out with the loot in your vehicle and on your player)

      <h2>Reinforce</h2>
      <p>
        You can join an ongoing Ikarus game as a reinforcement if you haven't died in that mission yet. If a squad from
        your company is already playing on the server, you will reinforce their mission. If not, you will get the guard
        mission and a free AK-74.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the game includes missions with depots, the reinforcements will be paradropped near a randomly chosen depot.
        You will start from 5km height and should open your parachute only after you see the ground. Otherwise you will
        spend quite a lot of time coming down. Also, watch your landing speed to avoid injury!
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Reinforcements will spawn with limited gear. Plan accordingly.

      <h2>Single player</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to play Ikarus with only one squad. The only available objective is the
        <b>Supply run</b> and the depot will be guarded by AI.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Other players can still reinforce games with only one squad. Stay alert.
