      <h2>Choosing the objective</h2>
      <p>
        When the Arma 3 mission starts the first player in squad will see the "Choose objective" menu. There the player can choose what objective they want to accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note, that even if you choose an objective, it won't always happen. This is because some objectives override other objectives.
        You might also be able to accomplish other, or more objectives, than the one you chose. If you get multiple tasks, feel free to chose what you want to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some objectives, like <b>Military base raid</b> or <b>Signal</b> require certain equipment to be available. You can choose them from the webpage just like other equipment.
      </p>


      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          If you are not certain what to choose, <b>Supply run</b> and <b>Guard duty</b> are safe choices.
        </p>

      <h2>Guard duty</h2>
      <p>
        With this objective you are opposing other squads and trying to prevent them from accomplishing their objectives. You will get rewards from every opponent you kill on 1km radius of any depot. You will also be rewarded further for each kill if you survive the mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guards cannot open <b>Loot boxes</b> in depots, but they can open the <b>Signal</b> cache. However, the guards can secure loot boxes for additional rewards. Securing a loot box happens just like opening it, but the box will be deleted when secured.
      </p>

      <p>
        If mission has a <b>Military base raid</b> all guard objectives will be cancelled and the <b>Military base raid</b> takes precedence. If too many squads have chosen guard, extra ones will be defaulted to <b>Supply runs</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guards can choose to paradrop to random depot at the start of the game.
      </p>


      <div class="info-box bg-info">

      <h2>Supply run</h2>
      <p>
        Goal for the Supply run is simply to find and loot the depot. Depot will contain two red and one green supply boxes. Red boxes can be opened freely, but the green box requires a level 1 loot key. You can get the loot key from either <b>Hold</b> or <b>Signal</b> objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        The green box will contain a level 2 loot key.
      </p>

      <p>
        Red boxes might contain a <b>Signal device</b> item, that allows you to choose the <b>Signal</b> objective.
      </p>

      <p>
        When 50 to 55 minutes of game time has elapsed a pair of bombers will come and destroy the depot. The first plane will just fly over the depot, but the second one will destroy it.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Rewards include large amounts of low level loot. Green box has better than medium level loot, but requires the key.

      <h2>Signal</h2>
      <p>
        This objective requires the <b>Signal device</b> that you can get from the <b>Supply run</b> objective. Goal of the squad having the signal device is to find a hidden cache while other squads try to hunt them down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Signal device allows you to perform <b>Triangulate</b> action, that will display current distance to the hidden cache. Triangulation has +/- 5% error and one minute cooldown. Triangulating multiple times on diffrent locations will allow you to deduct the location of the cache. The aproximate location of the cache will also be marked as a blue circle after 10, 15 and 20 minutes have elapsed. Radius of the circle will be 5km, 2km and 500m.
      </p>

      <p>
        Signal device will also reveal its location every 30 seconds. This means enemies will know where you are and will try to hunt you down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the signal device will also function as a key to the cache. You can't open the cache without a signal device.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Cache will have less but slightly better medium level loot compared to hold. Cache will also contain level 1 loot key.

      <h2>Hold</h2>
      <p>
        In hold objective you have to take and hold the depot for 5 minutes. You can't hold the depot before 30 minutes has elapsed. Holding the depot will reveal you a location of <b>equipment paradrop</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two squads must both select the hold for the objective to happen. If hold does not happen, squad objectives will be defaulted to Supply run.
      </p>

      <p>
        To hold the depot you simply have to be inside it. Multiple squads can hold the depot at the same time. Multiple players from same squad won't hold the depot faster though.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hold depot favors urban areas and will most often spawn in a town or a village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depot will contain only one green loot box that will require level 2 loot key to open. This box will contain high level loot and <b>Intelligence</b> item that you need to do the <b>Military base raid</b>. You can get the level 2 key from green box in supply depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        When 45 to 50 minutes has elapsed, the depot will self destruct. You will be warned by three siren sounds, each with 10 second interval.
      </p>

      <p>
        The paradrop will arrive approximately 5 to 10 minutes after first squad has held the depot.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">

      <h2>Military base raid</h2>
      <p>
        Military base raid is the rarest objective and will result in best possible loot. To choose a Military base raid, you will have to get <b>Intelligence</b> item from the green box in <b>Hold</b> depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three kinds of Military base raid loot: weapon, vehicle and helicopter. Weapon depot will have three red boxes that each will contain one high end weapon. Vehicle and helicopter depots will contain medium level loot in the boxes with one box containing key to a vehicle in the depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Type of the military depot will depend on type of the intelligence item.
      </p>

      <p>
        Military base raid will override all other objectives.

      <h2>Raid</h2>
      <p>
        Raid is a special objective where you attack against another company. Raid will for example show as "Raid Manateee-Warriors" in choose objective menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can only raid when you have more than 500 renown and you can only raid companies that have MORE renown than you. Your raid will be cancelled if you yourself are raided or if there is a <b>Military base raid</b> active.
      </p>

      <p>
        To win a raid you must enter the enemy base and hold their base cache for 5 minutes before 45 minutes of gametime has elapsed. However, if at any point after 25 minutes there are no attackers in 1km radius of defender base, the defender wins.
      </p>

       <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Winning a raid (either as a defender or attacker) will transfer 25% of enemy renown to your company.
