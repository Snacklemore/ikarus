      <h2>Choosing the objective</h2>
      <p>
        When the Arma 3 mission starts the first player in each squad will see the "Choose objective" menu.
        There the player can choose the objective the squad wants to accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that even if you choose an objective, it won't always happen. This is because some objectives chosen by
        other squads can override your objective. You may also be able to accomplish objectives that other squads chose
        for the game. If you get multiple tasks, feel free to choose what you want to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some objectives, like <b>Military base raid</b> or <b>Signal</b> require that you have selected specific
        equipment before joining the game.
      </p>


      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          If you are not certain what to choose, <b>Supply run</b> and <b>Guard duty</b> are safe choices.
        </p>

      <h2>Guard duty</h2>
      <p>
        With this objective you are opposing other squads and trying to prevent them from accomplishing their
        objectives. You will get rewarded for every opponent you kill. You will also be rewarded further for each kill
        if you survive the mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guards cannot accomplish normal missions or access loot in depots. In hold missions, however, guards can secure
        the advanced loot in the depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the game has a <b>Military base raid</b> objective, all guard objectives will be cancelled and the
        <b>Military base raid</b> takes precedence. If too many squads have chosen guard, extra ones will be defaulted
        to <b>Supply runs</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guards can choose to paradrop to a random depot at the start of the game.
      </p>

      <h2>Supply run</h2>
      <p>
        The goal for the Supply run objective is to find and loot a depot. The depot will contain two laptops and one
        advanced supply box. The map is scattered with blue dots that will contain either intel needed to find the
        depot, or supply keys to open the laptops. Opening the advanced box requires a level 1 loot key. You can get
        the loot key from <b>Hold</b> and <b>Signal</b> objectives.
      </p>

      <p><b>You will get most of the loot automatically to your company armory, by just opening the laptops.</b></p>

      <p>
        The advanced box will contain a level 2 loot key.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intel boxes found scattered around the objective area might contain quite good loot, including signal devices
        and static weapons.
      </p>

      <p>
        When 50 to 55 minutes of game time has elapsed, a pair of bombers will come and destroy the depot. The first
        plane will just fly over the depot, but the second one will destroy it.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Rewards include large amounts of low level loot. The advanced box has better than medium level loot, but
          requires the key.

      <h2>Signal</h2>
      <p>
        This objective requires the <b>Signal device</b> that you can get from the <b>Supply run</b> objective.
        The goal of the squad with the signal device is to find a hidden transmitter, while other squads try to hunt
        them down.
      </p>

      <p>
        The signal device allows you to perform the <b>Triangulate</b> action, which will display the current distance
        to the hidden transmitter. Triangulation has a +/- 5% error and one minute cooldown. Triangulating multiple
        times from different locations will allow you to deduce the location of the transmitter. The approximate
        location of the transmitter will also be marked as a blue circle after 10, 15 and 20 minutes have elapsed.
        The radius of the circle will be 5km, 2km and 500m.
      </p>

      <p>
        The signal device will also reveal its location every 30 seconds. This means enemies will know where you are and
        will try to hunt you down.
      </p>

      <p>
        After you find and activate the transmitter, an equipment cache will be paradropped somewhere within a 500m
        radius from the transmitter.
      </p>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          The equipment cache will have less but slightly better medium level loot, compared to the Hold objective.
          The cache will also contain a level 1 loot key.

      <h2>Hold</h2>
      <p>
        In the Hold objective you have to take and hold a depot for 5 minutes. You can't hold the depot before 30
        minutes of game time have elapsed. Holding the depot will reveal the location of an <b>equipment paradrop</b>
        to your squad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two squads must both select the Hold objective for it to happen. If the Hold does not happen, squad objectives
        will be defaulted to Supply run.
      </p>

      <p>
        To hold the depot you simply have to be inside it. Multiple squads can hold the depot at the same time. Multiple
        players from same squad won't hold the depot faster though.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Hold depot favors urban areas and will most often spawn in a town or village.
      </p>

      <p>
        The depot will contain one green loot box that will require a level 2 loot key to open. This box will contain
        high level loot and an <b>Intelligence</b> item that you need for selecting the <b>Military base raid</b>
        objective. You can get a level 2 loot key from the green box in the Supply depot objective.
      </p>

      <p>
        When 45 to 50 minutes have elapsed, the depot will self destruct. You will be warned by three siren sounds with
        10 second intervals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The paradrop will arrive approximately 5 to 10 minutes after the first squad has held the depot.

      <h2>Military base raid</h2>
      <p>
        Military base raid is the rarest objective and will result in the best possible loot. To choose the
        Military base raid objective, you will have to get an <b>Intelligence</b> item from the green box in the
        <b>Hold</b> objective depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three kinds of Military base raid loot: weapon, vehicle and helicopter. A weapon depot will have three
        red boxes that each contain one high end weapon. Vehicle and helicopter depots will contain medium level
        loot in boxes, with one box containing the key to a vehicle in the depot.
      </p>

      <p>
        The type of the military depot will depend on type of the Intelligence item.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Military base raid will override all other objectives.

      <h2>Raid</h2>
      <p>
        Raid is a special objective where you attack against another company. Raid will for example show as
        "Raid Manateee-Warriors" in the choose objective menu.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can only select the Raid objective when you have more than 500 renown, and you can only raid companies that
        have MORE renown than you. Your raid will be cancelled if you yourself are raided or if there is an active
        <b>Military base raid</b> objective.
      </p>

      <p>
        To win a raid you must enter the enemy base and hold their base cache for 5 minutes before 45 minutes of
        game time have elapsed. However, if at any point after 25 minutes there are no attackers inside a 1km radius of
        the defending base, the defender wins.
      </p>

       <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Winning a raid (as a defender or attacker) will transfer 25% of enemy renown to your company.
