      <h2>In misssion and to armory</h2>
      <p>
        You can get rewards in two different ways in ikarus. Either you get items in Ikarus mission and bring them back to your base or outpost, or you accomplish an objective during mission after which rewards will be directly deposited to your companys armory.
      </p>

      <p>
        No matter where you get items in Arma mission, you will get to keep them as long as you bring them back to your base. You can for example kill another player and bring back his equipment. Even if another player dies in your base, you will get to keep his equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rewards that give items directly to armory include opening the loot boxes, killing other players as a guard or as an underdog reward. After you complete these tasks, you don't need to worry about losing these rewards.
      </p>


      <div class="info-box bg-info">
        <p>
          Usually the bulk of the loot goes directly to armory, but the best loot are actual items in Arma mission.

      <h2>Kill and underdog(e) rewards</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you kill someone in ikarus, you gain a small kill renown reward: <a href="{{pathFor route='loot' _name='IKRS_kill_reward'}}">kill reward</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you kill someone from a squad that is twice the size of your squad size, you will gain underdog rewards. The squad sizes are counted as from highest amount of players in squad during that mission. So if your squad had 4 members, but all but you are dead, your squad is still considered to be 4 strong for underdog rewards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underdog reward level 3 is the only way to get a ghillie suit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reward leves goes as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="{{pathFor route='loot' _name='IKRS_underdog_reward_lvl1'}}">Enemy twice the size of your squad</a></li>

        <li><a href="{{pathFor route='loot' _name='IKRS_underdog_reward_lvl2'}}">Enemy three times the size of your squad</a></li>

        <li><a href="{{pathFor route='loot' _name='IKRS_underdog_reward_lvl3'}}">Enemy four times the size of your squad</a></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="info-box bg-info">
